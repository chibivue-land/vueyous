# Introduction

## Purpose of this book

The main objectives of this book are as follows:

- To be able to create composable functions with a focus on "reusability," "maintainability," and "extensibility" like VueUse
- To deepen the understanding of Vue.js and TypeScript by actually creating composable functions with various functionalities
- To learn practical coding techniques and best practices by reading open-source code

## Approach of this book

- **Minimal Reproduction**: We do not aim to fully replicate the composable functions of VueUse. We prioritize readability by implementing only the necessary minimum.

- **Clarity**: We explain complex concepts in an easy-to-understand manner and take care to ensure that readers can learn without stress. We use clear explanations and concrete examples to help readers understand smoothly.

- **Practicality**: We emphasize that the knowledge learned is useful in real-world development. We focus not only on theory but also on practical approaches to problem-solving and best practices.

## Target Audience

- Those who have used Vue.js
- Those who have used TypeScript
